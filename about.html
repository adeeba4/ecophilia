            <h3>Why <em>ecophilia</em>?</h3>
            <p>As a group of three university students, we founded <em>ecophilia</em> with the goal to make sustainable living easier 
                and more accessible for everyone. Since we are constantly surrounded by conversations about the future; we believe 
                it is imperative we take into consideration the health of our planet. We understand that the topic of climate change, 
                pollution, and carbon emissions can be overwhelming to think about without knowing what to do about it. We have also 
                been in the position of feeling powerless to make a difference, yet after extensive research and volunteering all 
                throughout Canada-we feel it is our duty to share our insights with the world.</p>
            
            <p>We wanted to build more than just another website with facts about the environment-we yearned to create a movement! 
                <em>ecophilia</em> is designed to help people make real, sustainable changes in their everyday lives, no matter where they're 
                starting from. Whether you're looking for simple eco-friendly swaps, tools to track your environmental footprint, or 
                resources to help you understand the impact you can make-we're here to make it simple and rewarding!</p>
